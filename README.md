Current Problems and what to do:
	
	1) GL_INVALID_OPERATION - cameraobj.cpp:147 ||| Ignore.
	
	2) Low framerate and or stream of GL_Errors in the console ||| Restart Program.
	
	3) Skybox disappearance ||| Restart Program.
	
	4) Weird & or rotated Textures ||| Restart Program.
	
Current bugged out Features:

	1) PARTICLE SYSTEMS not rendering particles ||| does not work, may cause crash.
	
	2) UItext ||| does not display textures correctly.
	
	3) Obj Instantiation funnctions ||| undefined behaviour, may cause crash.
